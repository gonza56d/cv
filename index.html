                                <li><strong>Python Developer at Intive (November 2021 - Currently)</strong>
                                    <br>I develop, enhance and maintain an ecosystem with more than 20 microservices running Python to make
                                    a digital wallet work. Most of them running on FastAPI and others on Flask, with REST architecture and also event-driven with
                                    RabbitMQ. In the tech stack we also use Postgres, Mongo and Redis. Our services live in AWS inside Kubernetes containers and we log them in datadog.
                                    We work with Scrum methodology.

                                <li><strong>Python Developer at Globant (April - October 2021)</strong>
                                    <br>I worked with Python and SQL (Equifax internal engine) on data analytics. I extracted data with raw SQL and later
                                    automatized the processes with Python.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Java Developer at Globant (January - March 2021)</strong>
                                    <br>I worked on QA tests automation with Java 11, Jenkins and Appium/Selenium. This was my first project with Scrum. Honestly I did not feel
                                    challenged most of the time, since my Java full stack background was way more challenging and I was looking for a Python project, but stepping 
                                    into a company like Globant allowed me to learn a lot of soft skills and later I could make my long time desired tech change.

                                    I put in production many complex functionalities such as Mercado Libre and WooCommerce integrations, helping to
